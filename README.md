# Coordinate-Saver-
Coordinate saver made with Python. EXPLANATION: You need python 3.13.7+ atleast to run this client. It will ask for a password to which you will make your own to enter the app or you dont have to and can have it as a passwordless software. Simply made for storing coords in a safe place.

If you are having issues save the files in the explorer thingy that opens into a text document. After deleting the explorer it will reset the app AND DATA once you do this the app will be reset. PS. You will likely not run into these issues unless you're not running the latest version of python 3.13.7+
